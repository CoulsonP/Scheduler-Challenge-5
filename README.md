## Usage
* This site is a place where a user can go to plan out their work day.
* When the page is loaded the user is shown a graph with the time 5am to 9pm.
* When the user clicks on one of the boxes they are allowed to type notes inside of the desired time.
* If they are satisfied with what they typed the user can then click a save button on the right side of the page to store the changes.
* User is also shown colored time blocks. The time blocks represnt past present and future times. Grey represents past, red as present, and green as future.
* The changes will stay the same even if the page is refreshed.
